# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a code assigned to an array. You would use them to give value to a set of code that can be called on when needed.

  Researched answer: Its a block of code designed to perform a particular task. You would invoke it when the specific task is needed to be performed.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() gives you the whole line of code and .filter() gives you specific value thats in the parenthesis

  Researched answer: .map() creates a function that pushes the array through a new sequence of code with the new results done by the .map() function and .filter() runs the array through a check system that searches for the specified condition



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() runs the whole code in the box thats specified while return tells the computer to give you a specified code that goes next to the command.

  Researched answer:  Console.log() writes a message to the console and return ends function execution and specifies a value to the function caller.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: its a line of code that is meant to be ran by the function.

  Researched answer: its an array object accessible inside  a function



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The proper way for pair programming is understanding that everyone codes differently and process the problems presented at a different speed. Always listen and ask questions respectfully if youre stuck look for answers with your partner.  
  The driver is the one that writes the code and the navigator is the one that helps solve the problem


  Researched answer:
  1-Prepare: Set enough time to go through code and have a comfortable space to work in
  2-Work closely: the driver writes the code and the navigator looks for mistakes and halts the driver if needed
  3-Learn and facilitate learning: if your working with someone with less experience then you be patient and facilitate the asking of questions.
  4-Establish a rhythm: Every 15-30 minutes switch roles in order to stay focused and on pace.
  5-Communicate effectively: Dont be afraid to ask questions and ask to slow down a bit if you dont understand the instructions or feel pressured into an answer
